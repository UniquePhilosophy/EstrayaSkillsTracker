# EstrayaSkillsTracker
Estraya is a Skills Tracking prototype which showcases some features from a full stack development roadmap, including APIs, state, security, graphics & functionality.

## Full Stack
With the backend in Django/Django REST Framework and the frontend in React, this application displays asynchronous API calls from client to server.

## Stateful
The app uses React & Redux to create a stateful system.

## Secure
This app features some basic security features such as SSL/HTTPS and CSRF tokens. It also demonstrates custom authentication tokens, Django middleware and HTTP-only cookies for safe data transfer.

## D3 Data Science Graphing
Making use of the d3-dag library and the sugiyama algorithmic layout, tasks are able to be graphed in a visually striking manner.

## Functional Skills Tracking
There's a simple mathematical model which underpins the skills/tasks system so that users can accurately represent their progress and compare it to other users if desired.
